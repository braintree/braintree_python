class Configuration(object):
    """
    A class representing the configuration of your Braintree account.
    You must call configure before any other Braintree operations. ::

        braintree.Configuration.configure(
            braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
            "your_merchant_id",
            "your_public_key",
            "your_private_key"
        )

    By default, every request to the Braintree servers verifies the SSL connection
    using the `PycURL <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_
    library.  This ensures valid encryption of data and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

    If you are in an environment where you absolutely cannot load `PycURL <http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/>`_, you
    can turn off SSL Verification by setting::

        Configuration.use_unsafe_ssl = True

    This is highly discouraged, however, since it leaves you susceptible to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.

    If you are using Google App Engine, you must use unsafe ssl [1]_::

        The proxy the URL Fetch service uses cannot authenticate the host it
        is contacting. Because there is no certificate trust chain, the proxy
        accepts all certificates, including self-signed certificates. The
        proxy server cannot detect "man in the middle" attacks between App
        Engine and the remote host when using HTTPS.
