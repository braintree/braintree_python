Braintree Python Client Library
===============================

The Braintree library provides integration access to the Braintree
Gateway.

Dependencies
------------

-  Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5
-  `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__

Upgrading from 2.x.x to 3.x.x
-----------------------------

On Python 2.6 or 2.7 with default settings / requests:

No changes are required to upgrade to version 3.

On Python 2.6 or 2.7 with pycurl, httplib, or use\_unsafe\_ssl = True:

Install requests and test that you are able to connect to the Sandbox
environment with version 3 and without specifying an HTTP strategy. The
use\_unsafe\_ssl parameter will be ignored.

On Python 2.5:

Python 2.5 isn't supported by version 3 of the library. Most code that
runs on 2.5 will work unmodified on Python 2.6. After making sure your
code works on Python 2.6, follow the instructions above for upgrading
from pycurl / httplib to requests.

Quick Start Example
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import braintree

    braintree.Configuration.configure(
        braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
        "your_merchant_id",
        "your_public_key",
        "your_private_key"
    )

    result = braintree.Transaction.sale({
        "amount": "1000.00",
        "payment_method_nonce": nonce_from_the_client,
        "options": {
            "submit_for_settlement": True
        }
    })

    if result.is_success:
        print("success!: " + result.transaction.id)
    elif result.transaction:
        print("Error processing transaction:")
        print("  code: " + result.transaction.processor_response_code)
        print("  text: " + result.transaction.processor_response_text)
    else:
        for error in result.errors.deep_errors:
            print("attribute: " + error.attribute)
            print("  code: " + error.code)
            print("  message: " + error.message)

Testing
-------

Our friends at `Venmo <https://venmo.com>`__ have `an open source
library <https://github.com/venmo/btnamespace>`__ designed to simplify
testing of applications using this library.

The unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration
specs are meant to be run against a local development server of our
gateway code. These integration specs are not meant for public
consumption and will likely fail if run on your system. To run unit
tests use rake(\ ``rake test:unit``) or
nose(\ ``nosetests tests/unit``).
